# Concept of a Single Article page

In a blog, whenever you read a post, that's when you read a single article. Personally, I usually call it single page, detail page, etc. 

If you take a look at the [article_table](/docs/db/article_table.md), you could see that when we create a table to store our article, there's always a field/column called `ID`. In many websites, to view a single article by accessing to its ID.

So basically, when you are going to a single article, you are simply viewing a single row of a table (in this case `article` table).
