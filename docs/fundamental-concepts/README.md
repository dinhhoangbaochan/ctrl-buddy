# PHP Fundamental Concepts

This directory contains many explanation for coding fundamentals, such as `if-else`, `variables`, etc. And these fundamental concepts are widely used in most programming language, not just PHP, so whenever you learn a new language, just remember to search about these concepts and how to use them in that language and you will soon get comfortable in using that language.

## Basic Concepts

### Variables

Every languages have variables, without variables there's no programming language. You need to learn how to declare a variable in a programming language, that's first simple rule. A variable is a piece of information that you will use later on in your program. It's mutable (means it can be changed during our process) and can be anything. Your name can be a variable, your age can be too. To define a variable, most of the time it can be like this:

```
variable_name = information
```

Example:

```
my_name = "Chan"
```

The example is not written in any specific programming language, it's just a pseudo code to explain how it works. Now take PHP for example, here's how you declare a variable:

```PHP
$database_name = "my_database";
```
