# What is constant?

Similar to math, constants in programming share the same concept. They are information that is not mutable, and you can think of them as variables except that you can't redeclare and update their values.

## How to define constants in PHP?

Simple, just do like this:

```PHP
define('CONSTANT_NAME', 'constant_value');

// For example:
define('MY_NAME', 'CHAN');
```

As you could already tell, for most of the time, constant key (or constant name) should be set to all capital.
