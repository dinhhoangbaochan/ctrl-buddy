# Concept of an Archive Page

In a blog, most of the time, you will see there are pages that show all the posts or articles that related in a same topic. These pages can be called Archive Pages. 

Archive Pages are pages that contain a `loop` of posts queried from database that related to a topic, for example:
- Category: A page that will show posts shared the same category.
- Tag: A page that will show posts shared the same tag.
- Month: A page that will show posts posted in the same month.

This is how I understand it, not sure if it's 100% correct, but so far I haven't run into any issue understanding it this way, so you could understand it like me.
