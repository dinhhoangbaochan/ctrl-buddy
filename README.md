# PHP Buddy - My PHP Blog

Well, after 5 years of working as a PHP developer, I finally got my first PHP certificate. And though it's just a course completion certificate, still it's my first dev certificate. This repository is a blog that I make to revise my whole learning process, following the course that I learned.

If you are a PHP beginner, this repository is a perfect start for you to learn PHP. Throughout everyfile, I'll try to document what I've learned, what things mean. 

## Table of content

I will list down here the content list of all doc that I've written in `docs` folder.
