# PHP Buddy - My PHP Blog

Well, after 5 years of working as a PHP developer, I finally got my first PHP certificate. And though it's just a course completion certificate, still it's my first dev certificate. This repository is a blog that I make to revise my whole learning process, following the course that I learned.

If you are a PHP beginner, this repository is a perfect start for you to learn PHP.

## How this repo works
This repository will contain a source of a blog, built with PHP. Besides the source code, I'll put a directory called [`doc`](/docs/) which will contain all the documentation of what I've learned about PHP, MySQL / SQL, etc., in the most simple way of how I understand everything. In addition, PHP is a kind of simple language and it's quite easy to learn, to get used to it and to actually build something based on it. 

Don't get me wrong, PHP is obviously capable of building something complex, but also its simplicity is the reason why I love it (just like many people do) and use it to this day. So learning PHP is a great start for you to get familiar with coding and all the basic concepts of coding (such as `loop`, `condition`, `variables`, `data types`, etc.). And don't worry, I'm an idiot so if I understand it, then you can understand it.

## Table of content

I will list down here the content list of all doc that I've written in `docs` folder.
